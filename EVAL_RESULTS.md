## PR #1: Broken Authentication - Password Check Removed

**Branch**: `eval/broken-auth`
**Category**: Security/Authentication
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Files Changed**: `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`

### Bug Description
Removed password validation from login endpoint. The API now only checks if the username matches, completely ignoring the password field. This allows anyone to login with just the username.

### Code Change
```javascript
// Before:
if (username === expectedUser && password === expectedPass)

// After:
if (username === expectedUser)  // Password check removed!
```

### Expected Bot Behavior
The bot should:
1. Generate a test that tries to login with correct username but wrong password
2. Test should detect that login succeeds when it shouldn't
3. Flag this as a critical security vulnerability

### Test Cases Bot Should Generate
- ✅ Login with correct username and correct password (should pass)
- ✅ Login with correct username and wrong password (should fail but currently passes - BUG!)
- ✅ Login with wrong username (should fail)
- ✅ Login with empty password (should fail but currently passes - BUG!)

### Success Criteria
- Bot identifies the security vulnerability
- Generated test catches the authentication bypass
- Severity marked as critical/high
